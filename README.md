# car-animation-with-glut
A simple car animation project made with glut for university lab project

This project was developed as a learning project for my computer graphics lab course. The project uses freeglut and is developed on codeblocks 20.03 on a Windows 10 64-bit machine.

The project features only a minimal car design that runs on a straight street. The car can be moved left and right on the path. The environment features some objects built using basic shapes.

The control keybindings are - 
* 'K' to start the car.
* 'P' to pause and unpause.
* 'A' and 'D' to move car left and right on the path respectively.
* 'L' to toggle global illumation.
* 'O' to toggle car headlight.
* 'R' to reset the car to initial position.

The project touched several features of glut such as texturing, lighting, object drawing, curved surface drawing, keyboard input processing etc.
